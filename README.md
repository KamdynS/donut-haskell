Implementing donut.c in Haskell.

My first foray into the language. 

I basically ripped the code from this article: https://www.a1k0n.net/2011/07/20/donut-math.html Check it out if you never have before!

I did this because most of the interest in this project was in writing Haskell, not in deriving the formulae on my own.
